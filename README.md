# Linear regression algorithm to predict sales 
Country Beeristan, a high potential market, accounts for nearly 10% of Stallion & Co.'s global beer sales. Stallion & Co. has a large portfolio of products distributed to retailers through wholesalers (agencies). There are thousands of unique wholesaler-SKU/products combinations. In order to plan its production and distribution as well as help wholesalers with their planning, it is important for Stallion & Co. to have an accurate estimate of demand at SKU level for each wholesaler.

Currently demand is estimated by sales executives, who generally have a “feel” for the market and predict the net effect of forces of supply, demand and other external factors based on past experience. The more experienced a sales exec is in a particular market, the better a job he does at estimating. Joshua, the new Head of S&OP for Stallion & Co. just took an analytics course and realized he can do the forecasts in a much more effective way. He approaches you, the best data scientist at Stallion, to transform the exercise of demand forecasting.
