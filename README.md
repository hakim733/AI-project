# Building a Data-Driven Future: Predicting Beer Sales with Linear Regression


 I tackled a real-world machine learning challenge: accurately predicting soda sales at the SKU level for thousands of wholesaler-product combinations.

Leveraging the power of linear regression, I developed a model that outperformed traditional sales forecasting methods. By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and external factors, I was able to build a robust model that provides valuable insights into future demand.

Key achievements:

Improved forecasting accuracy: Our model significantly reduced forecast errors, leading to more efficient inventory management and reduced stockouts.
Enhanced decision-making: The model empowers sales executives to make data-driven decisions, optimizing sales strategies.
Streamlined operations: By automating the forecasting process, we saved time and resources.
Technical skills:

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
